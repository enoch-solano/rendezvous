# rendezvous
Rendezvous is an app for users to create events for other users to see.
The app consists of a login/logout feature, with sign in and sign up options.
Logged in users can decide whether or not to attend the event.
Events can be created only by users that are logged in.
Users can only modify, edit, and destroy events that they host (i.e. created).
